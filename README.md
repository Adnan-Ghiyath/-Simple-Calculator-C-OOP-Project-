# 🧮 Simple Calculator (C++ OOP Project)

A simple educational calculator built using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming principles.

This project demonstrates how to manage calculator state, handle basic arithmetic operations, and apply encapsulation using classes.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide operations
- Prevent division by zero
- Store previous result
- Cancel last operation (Undo)
- Clear calculator state
- Console-based output

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Standard Library (`iostream`)

---

## 📂 Project Structure
- `Calculiter.cpp` — Main calculator implementation

---
## 🎯 Purpose
This project was created as a learning exercise to practice C++ fundamentals and object-oriented programming concepts.
----

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- Classes and Objects
- Private vs Public members
- Encapsulation
- State tracking
- Defensive programming (division by zero)

---

## ▶️ Example Usage
```cpp
Calculiter calc;
calc.Add(10);
calc.Sub(5);
calc.Div(2);
calc.PrintResult();
